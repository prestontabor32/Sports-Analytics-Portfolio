# Generalized Linear Model Project

## Overview

This project analyzed NFl team performance data using GLMs. I wanted to see how explosive plays impacted the game. An explosive play is either a 15+ yards run or a 20+ yard completed pass. So, I chose to analyze data on passes with 20+ air yards as well as touchdown probability based on run length and completed pass length. 

## Lessons Learned

This project taught me how to understand and apply GLMs to model NFL team performance. I also learned how to interpret the results of the models to derive meaningful insights that can be used for future predictions.
