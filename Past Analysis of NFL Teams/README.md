# Past Analysis of NFL Teams

## Overview

This project was one of my first of the year and allowed me to begin applying various skills with Python programming. The goal was to take 8 NFL teams, 4 from the NFC and 4 from the AFC, and perform an analysis of their recent performance over the last several seasons. 

## Lessons Learned

This project taught me the basic process and structure that goes into sports analytics development and analysis. The most important lesson learned here was the importance of organization and proper structure when preparing the data, because this makes analysis much easier and effective.

The steps included:

- Data Preparation
- Cleaning & Preprocessing
- Exploratory Data Analysis
- Interpretation & Analysis
- Summary Findings
