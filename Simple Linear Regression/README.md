# Simple Linear Regression Project

## Overview

This project focused on the relationship between two variables using simple linear regression. The variables I chose were QBR (Quarterback Rating) per Pass Attempt and Air Yards per Pass Attempt. 

## Lessons Learned

I learned about using DataFrames in my EDA to help structure and organize the specific data I wanted to analyze. I also used matplotlib and seaborn to create scatterplots to visualize my data. Finally, I used statsmodels to to build my simple linear regression model as shown below in my relevant outputs and visualizations.
