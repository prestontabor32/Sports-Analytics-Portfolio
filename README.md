This repository highlights various projects I have created in my Sports Analytics Development class at Harding University. Python is the primary programming language used throughout each project. I have learned how to conduct Data Preparation, Preprocessing, EDAs, Modeling, Interpretation and Analysis, and various other integral skills for working with large datasets.
