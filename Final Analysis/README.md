Sports Analytics Development has been an incredible class this semester and I have gained valuable skills and insights that will help further my interest and career in sports data analytics. From beginning with basic data anlysis with histograms, to building regression and machine learning models to predict player career success, the growth this semester has been exciting. Each project continued to build off each other becoming more complex and in-depth leading to some reallyt insightful analysis and results.

## Major Findings

I think my biggest takeaways from this semester has been finding which areas of sports analytics development I thrive in and enjoy the most. This area has to be the Exploratory Data Analysis and Visualization of data. These sections of data analysis provide so much room for freedom, and I discovered various different ways to dive deep into the data we were evaluating.
