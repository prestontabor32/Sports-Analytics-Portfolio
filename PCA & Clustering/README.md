# PCA & Clustering Project

## Overview

This project allowed me to work with principal component analysis and clustering techniques to interpret NFL data. I chose to analyze features such as total yards, touchdowns, passing and rushing yards, turnovers, and sacks. Using these to create principal components and clusters to interpret which factors contribute most to team success.

## Lessons Learned

I learned how to aggregate and standard the features listed above so that the data could be accurately analyzed and interpreted. I also learned how to develop and use scree plots and the elbow methods to work with my principal components and clusters.

## Relevant Outputs/Visualizations

<ins>Scree Plot:</ins> Helped determine the number of principal components that encapsulated the majority of explained variance
