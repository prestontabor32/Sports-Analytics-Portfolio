# Web Scraping Project

## Overview

This project centered around the collection of NFL draft and scouting data from various websites through web scraping. I then took this data and performed EDA and built a machine learning model to predict player success in the NFL. 

## Lessons Learned

I learned various web scraping techniques using Python. I also learned how to build a machine learning model that is used to predict player success. Some new skills and features used included decision tree classifiers and feature importance.
